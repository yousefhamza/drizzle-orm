## Development

### Setup

To setup dependencies needed, you first need to run

```
pnpm install
```

Then you will need to run the development postgres DB

```
docker run --name my_postgress_2 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=adminadmin -e POSTGRES_DB=pgtest -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

#### Running the code

Run dev using ts-node

```
pnpm run dev:ts-node
```

### Testing the db

Run tests

```
pnpm run test
```

### Issues

1. There's a dispartiy between the old postgres version used and the one used in Drizzle-orm, so I have to set the postgress version explicitly
2. Postgress have to be imported like this `import * as postgres from "postgres"`, importing withoout `* as` results in `function not found error`
